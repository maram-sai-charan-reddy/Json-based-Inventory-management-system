# Json-based-Inventory-management-system
Using JSON to tackle the hard situations and to make it easy about how we make inventory management system.

**Topics covered**
Python 3
JSON
file handling
usage of dictionaries
time

I used jupyter notebook and python 3 to finish the task.

Firstly, we can take the data from input and give it to the dictionary, in my case it is named as resource.

Secondly, we import json and then we try to dump it into the json format,
if the file already does not exist it creates a file and fill it in with the data.
But, here the .json file contains data in str format.

We can also convert this .json file into dictionary format again using load.

There is also another feature we can use is time stamp by importing time and using ctime to get the current time from the system
at that moment.
